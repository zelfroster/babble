## This file contains the todo list for this project, so I can keep track of the features and be accountable as well

#### Frontend

[ ] Show different colors for every username and make it persist. (in future allow user to set custom colors for username like Twitch)
[ ] Start websocket only after user enters username and proceeds to chat room.
[ ] Make Quit button work and take user to homescreen after quitting.
[ ] Add more info on homescreen.

#### Backend

[ ] Store username permanently so that we don't send username everytime with the message from frontend.
[ ] Integrate Postgresql for storing some data permanently.

For now, I can only think for these features. I will add more goals as the project progresses.
