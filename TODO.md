## This file contains the todo list for this project

#### Frontend

- [ ] Show different colors for every username and make it persist. (in future
      allow user to set custom colors for username like Twitch)
- [ ] Start websocket only after user enters username and proceeds to chat room.
- [ ] Make Quit button work and take user to homescreen after quitting.
- [ ] Add more info on homescreen.

#### Backend

- [x] Integrate Postgresql for storing some data permanently.
- [x] Add SignUp and SignIn functionality.
- [ ] Add Logout feature to be able to quit from the frontend side.
- [ ] Store username permanently so that we don't send username everytime with
      the message from frontend.
- [ ] Add ability to create private rooms/groups/servers.

For now, I can only think for these features. I will add more goals as the
project progresses.
